        <h1 id="Home-Cooking-FC-Barcelona’s-Recipe-for-Beating-Real-Madrid"><a href="#Home-Cooking-FC-Barcelona’s-Recipe-for-Beating-Real-Madrid" class="headerlink" title="Home Cooking: FC Barcelona’s Recipe for Beating Real Madrid"></a>Home Cooking: FC Barcelona’s Recipe for Beating Real Madrid</h1><p>On November 21, 2017, Barcelona hosted arch-rivals Real Madrid in the latest edition of El Clásico. The match was a crucial one for both clubs – with only four points separating them at the top of La Liga table – and it was Barça who came away with the victory, beating Los Blancos 3-0.</p>
<p>The home team took the lead in the first half through an own goal from Marcelo, before doubling their advantage in the second half through goals from Lionel Messi and Aleix Vidal.</p>
<p>Here we take a look at how Barcelona were able to win at home and give their fans something to celebrate.</p>
<p>Tactical discipline and organisation</p>
<p>One of the key reasons for Barcelona’s victory was their tactical discipline and organisation. They were defensively solid throughout the match, limiting Madrid to very few chances.</p>
<p>In midfield, Sergio Busquets and Ivan Rakitic ensured that Barcelona retained possession for long periods of the game, while also tracking back when needed to help out defensively. And up front, Messi and Luis Suarez worked hard off the ball to close down Madrid’s defenders.</p>
<p>This defensivesolidity was key in preventing Madrid from building any momentum in the game, and as a result they never really looked like scoring.</p>
<p>Individual brilliance from Messi</p>
<p>While Barcelona’s organisation was important, it was Messi who proved to be the difference-maker on the night. The Argentine scored one goal and created another, putting on a masterclass display which ultimately led to his side’s victory.</p>
<p>Messi has always been a big match player, and he once again proved why he is considered one of the best players in history. He is capable of producing moments of magic which can decide games on his own, and that is exactly what he did against Madrid.</p>
<p> Comfortable home win</p>
<p>Overall, this was a comfortable home win for Barcelona against their biggest rivals. They controlled the match from start to finish, rarely allowing Madrid any chances to get back into it. And while they may not have played their best football, they were still good enough to take all three points.</p>
<h1 id="Pressure-Mounts-as-Madrid-Ready-to-Take-On-Atletico-in-Champions-League-Home-Game"><a href="#Pressure-Mounts-as-Madrid-Ready-to-Take-On-Atletico-in-Champions-League-Home-Game" class="headerlink" title="Pressure Mounts as Madrid Ready to Take On Atletico in Champions League Home Game"></a>Pressure Mounts as Madrid Ready to Take On Atletico in Champions League Home Game</h1><p>The pressure is on for Spanish giant Real Madrid as they prepare to take on city rivals Atletico Madrid in their Champions League home game Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Real Madrid is coming into the matchup on the heels of a rough stretch that has seen them drop Liga points to Valencia and Levante, while also being eliminated from the Copa Del Rey. In Champions League play, they registered a win over Ajax but needed a controversial goal by captain Sergio Ramos to do so. They currently sit in second place in their group, two points behind Bavarian giant Bayern Munich.</p>
<p>Atletico Madrid is currently leading La Liga with a record of 22-4-4 and 68 points, 10 more than their crosstown rivals. Los Rojiblancos are coming off a rough patch themselves, however, having lost their last match in all competitions against Girona. They still hold first place in their Champions League group with 12 points and have yet to concede a goal in the tournament.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s match at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium is shaping up to be an epic encounter. Both teams desperately need three points from the game in order to keep pace or gain ground in their respective tournaments. Expect both sides to come out guns blazing as they look to take one step closer to potential glory.</p>
<h1 id="Champions-League-hostilities-resume-with-remarkable-home-record-for-holders-Real-Madrid-in-question"><a href="#Champions-League-hostilities-resume-with-remarkable-home-record-for-holders-Real-Madrid-in-question" class="headerlink" title="Champions League hostilities resume with remarkable home record for holders Real Madrid in question"></a>Champions League hostilities resume with remarkable home record for holders Real Madrid in question</h1><p>As the UEFA Champions League resumes, holders Real Madrid travel to Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday with their remarkable home record in question.</p>
<p>Los Blancos became the first team ever to win back-to-back Champions League crowns last season, but started this campaign with a shock 3-0 defeat away to Spurs.</p>
<p>Zinedine Zidane will be keen for his side to get their title defence back on track, but knows they face a tough task at Wembley Stadium.</p>
<p>Since 2010&#x2F;11, Madrid have won 33 of their 38 Champions League games at the Bernabeu – losing just twice. However, they’ve failed to win any of their last six matches on the road in Europe’s premier club competition.</p>
<p>Spurs themselves are unbeaten in 12 European fixtures (W7 D5), while they haven’t lost at home in this competition since October 2010 against Inter Milan. Mauricio Pochettino’s side are also one of only three teams (along with Barcelona and Liverpool) who have beaten Real Madrid at the Bernabeu in the past decade.</p>
<p>This makes Wednesday’s clash a mouth-watering prospect, and it should be an interesting battle between two of Europe’s top sides.</p>
<h1 id="Juventus-hope-to-turn-Turin-into-a-fortress-against-Real-Madrid"><a href="#Juventus-hope-to-turn-Turin-into-a-fortress-against-Real-Madrid" class="headerlink" title="Juventus hope to turn Turin into a fortress against Real Madrid"></a>Juventus hope to turn Turin into a fortress against Real Madrid</h1><p>Juventus take on Spanish giants Real Madrid in their Champions League semi-final first leg at the Allianz Stadium in Turin. The Bianconeri have had a good season thus far and will be looking to progress to the final of Europe’s premier club competition.</p>
<p>Manager Massimiliano Allegri has had to deal with many injury problems in his squad, but the Italian tactician will be hoping that his side can give a good account of themselves against Los Blancos. Both teams have pedigree in the European Cup, with Juventus winning it twice and Madrid lifting the trophy on four occasions.</p>
<p>It is likely that Allegri will deploy a 4-3-3 formation for Wednesday night’s clash, with Gonzalo Higuain set to lead the line. Douglas Costa, Paulo Dybala and Mario Mandzukic could all start in attack, while Giorgio Chiellini and Medhi Benatia are expected to marshal the defence.</p>
<p>Real Madrid head into the tie as favourites but Juventus will be hopeful of causing an upset at home. The Spanish side are aiming to become the first team ever to win three successive Champions League titles and they have been impressive so far in this year’s competition.</p>
<p>Zinedine Zidane’s men booked their place in the semi-finals with a 7-1 aggregate win over Bayern Munich, although they were given a scare by La Liga minnows Leganes in their quarter-final tie. Cristiano Ronaldo has been in superb form this season, scoring 42 goals in all competitions, and he will be looking to add more goals to his tally against Juventus.</p>
<p>The Italian champions have not been beaten at home all season and they will be looking to make the Allianz Stadium into a fortress against Madrid on Wednesday night. Juventus have not reached a Champions League final since 1996 and they will be determined to make up for lost time by beating Real Madrid in this year’s semi-finals.</p>
<h1 id="Bayern-Munich-aim-to-extend-their-unbeaten-run-at-the-Allianz-Arena-against-Real-Madrid"><a href="#Bayern-Munich-aim-to-extend-their-unbeaten-run-at-the-Allianz-Arena-against-Real-Madrid" class="headerlink" title="Bayern Munich aim to extend their unbeaten run at the Allianz Arena against Real Madrid"></a>Bayern Munich aim to extend their unbeaten run at the Allianz Arena against Real Madrid</h1><p>On Wednesday night, Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich will be looking to extend their unbeaten run at the Allianz Arena and Bookmakers are offering odds on them achieving this feat. </p>
<p>Bayern come into the game in good form, having beaten rivals Borussia Dortmund 3-1 in Der Klassiker last weekend. The Bavarian side then followed that up with a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Club Brugge in the Champions League, with Robert Lewandowski scoring the decisive goal. </p>
<p>Los Blancos, on the other hand, have had a difficult start to their season. They currently find themselves sixth in La Liga, seven points adrift of leaders Barcelona, and were knocked out of the Champions League at the hands of Ajax Amsterdam. </p>
<p>One man who will be looking to make an impact for Real Madrid is Eden Hazard. The former Chelsea man has started the season well, registering two goals and two assists in his first six games for his new club. </p>
<p>This clash is sure to be a thrilling encounter and one that is not to be missed.</p>
