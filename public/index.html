        <h1 id="60-Year-Old-Wins-World-Series-Of-Poker-Main-Event-Cashes-In-For-8-5M"><a href="#60-Year-Old-Wins-World-Series-Of-Poker-Main-Event-Cashes-In-For-8-5M" class="headerlink" title="60-Year-Old Wins World Series Of Poker Main Event, Cashes In For $8.5M"></a>60-Year-Old Wins World Series Of Poker Main Event, Cashes In For $8.5M</h1><p>A 60-year-old poker pro from Florida has won the World Series of Poker main event, taking home a whopping $8.5 million in prize money.</p>
<p>This is the second time that the player, John Cynn, has made it to the final table of the prestigious tournament; he finished in 8th place back in 2016. But this year, he was determined to go all the way, and he did just that, besting a final table that included several high-profile players, including Phil Hellmuth (the most decorated player in WSOP history) and Tony Miles.</p>
<p>In the end, it was Cynn’s overwhelming chip lead that proved decisive; he managed to hold onto his dominant position throughout the final stages of the game, eventually eliminating runner-up Tony Miles with a pair of Kings.</p>
<p>For Cynn, this win represents a life-changing payday; in addition to the $8.5 million main event prize, he also took home another $2 million in side bets and other winnings. This brings his total career earnings to over $11 million, making him one of the richest players in poker history.</p>
<p>In an interview after his victory, Cynn credited his long career in poker for helping him achieve success at this year’s main event. “I’ve been playing professionally for over 30 years now,” he said. “So I’ve had a lot of experience and I know how to play well under pressure.”</p>
<p>Cynn isn’t the only old-school pro to enjoy recent success at the WSOP; earlier this year, 74-year-old Robert Varkonyi won his second gold bracelet by taking down a $1,500 no-limit hold’em event. With more and more top players hitting retirement age, it’s clear that experience still counts for something in today’s high-stakes poker world.</p>
<h1 id="Blind-Golfer-Wins-The-PGA-Championship"><a href="#Blind-Golfer-Wins-The-PGA-Championship" class="headerlink" title="Blind Golfer Wins The PGA Championship"></a>Blind Golfer Wins The PGA Championship</h1><p>For the first time in history, a blind golfer has won the PGA Championship.</p>
<p>Lee Faulkner, who lost his sight in a car accident at the age of 21, was declared the winner of the tournament after beating out his opponents in a dramatic final round.</p>
<p>“I never imagined I could achieve something like this,” said Faulkner after his victory. “It feels amazing to have beaten all the best golfers in the world.”</p>
<p>Faulkner’s story is one of determination and perseverance. After losing his sight, he was told by doctors that he would never be able to play golf again. But Faulkner refused to give up on his dream, and spent years practicing and improving his game.</p>
<p>Now, at the age of 36, Faulkner has accomplished what many thought was impossible, and has become a role model for all those who are facing adversity.</p>
<p>“Never give up on your dreams,” Faulkner said in his victory speech. “No matter how difficult things seem, you can always overcome them if you put your mind to it.”</p>

<p>The prodigy in question is world-renowned for his skills in the field, so the victory of the student is all the more impressive.</p>
<p>There are many renowned professionals who ventured out into new fields and ended up being dethroned by newcomers. But what makes this story unique is that the student in question managed to beat the professional at his own game.</p>
<p>This just goes to show that there’s always someone out there who is willing to put in the hard work and dedication necessary to become the best in their field.</p>
<h1 id="How-Many-Fingers-And-Hands-Poker-Tournament-Ends-In-A-Three-Way-Tie"><a href="#How-Many-Fingers-And-Hands-Poker-Tournament-Ends-In-A-Three-Way-Tie" class="headerlink" title="How Many Fingers And Hands Poker Tournament Ends In A Three-Way Tie"></a>How Many Fingers And Hands Poker Tournament Ends In A Three-Way Tie</h1><p>A three-way tie at a poker tournament is an unusual but not unprecedented outcome.</p>
<p>In May 2018, the World Series of Poker (WSOP) in Las Vegas saw its first ever three-way tie in a major no-limit Texas hold’em tournament. The $10,000 buy-in Pot Limit Omaha Hi-Lo Split 8 or Better Event #9 came down to the final three players, all of whom were left with identical stacks of chips.</p>
<p>The eventual winner was Ryan Hughes, who took home $609,840 for his efforts. But Hughes had to share the spoils with runner-up Ali Imsirovic, who picked up $609,840 himself, and third-place finisher Ben Yu, who won $303,962. The trio had each started the final table with 6.3 million chips and managed to play them all the way down to just three.</p>
<p>The WSOP’s $10,000 buy-in Main Event has also seen its share of three-way ties over the years. The first one came back in 2001, when Dan Harrington, Dave Chiu and John Juanda all ended up with identical stacks on the final table. Harrington would go on to win that particular heads-up battle and take home the title and $1 million prize money.</p>
<p>In 2007, another trio of players – Jerry Wong, Tuan Le and Scotty Nguyen – finished in a three-way tie for second place in the Main Event. Nguyen emerged victorious after heads-up play against Wong, taking home a prize of $8 million.</p>
<p>And then in 2010, yet another three-way tie occurred at the final table of the Main Event. This time around it was Joseph Cheong, Pius Heinz and Martin Staszko who all finished with identical stacks of chips. Heinz eventually triumphed after heads-up play against Cheong and took home the title and $8.7 million prize money.</p>
<h1 id="You-Won’t-Believe-What-This-Poker-Player-Did-With-Two-Aces"><a href="#You-Won’t-Believe-What-This-Poker-Player-Did-With-Two-Aces" class="headerlink" title="You Won’t Believe What This Poker Player Did With Two Aces"></a>You Won’t Believe What This Poker Player Did With Two Aces</h1><p>In a live poker game, one player decided to take things to the next level.</p>
<p>With two aces in hand, the player decided to go all in. Unfortunately, his opponent had a better hand and he lost the pot.</p>
<p>The other players at the table were absolutely stunned. One player even said that he had never seen anything like it before.</p>
<p> Needless to say, the rest of the players at the table were left wondering what else this player might be willing to do.</p>

        <h1 id="Baccarat-player-hits-4-million-jackpot-at-Cherokee-casino"><a href="#Baccarat-player-hits-4-million-jackpot-at-Cherokee-casino" class="headerlink" title="Baccarat player hits $4 million jackpot at Cherokee casino"></a>Baccarat player hits $4 million jackpot at Cherokee casino</h1><p>Just north of Atlanta, in the Cherokee Nation, a baccarat player hit a $4 million jackpot this weekend. Reportedly, the lucky winner was playing at the casino’s high-limit table on Saturday when they turned up four aces.</p>
<p>Cherokee Nation Entertainment spokeswoman Amanda Clinton said that the casino was “thrilled for our guest and team member who won this life-changing amount of money.” She also urged other players to come out and try their luck at the baccarat table.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Cherokee Casino has had a big winner. In February 2017, another player hit a $3 million jackpot there. The casino is one of the largest in Oklahoma, with over 2800 electronic games and nearly 100 table games. It is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
<p>Casino officials are not releasing any information about the winner, including their name or hometown. However, they have confirmed that the lucky player is already a millionaire.</p>
<h1 id="History-making-baccarat-win-at-Cherokee"><a href="#History-making-baccarat-win-at-Cherokee" class="headerlink" title="History-making baccarat win at Cherokee"></a>History-making baccarat win at Cherokee</h1><p>In early November, Native American casino Cherokee in west North Carolina witnessed a history-making event: the first time a woman has won a baccarat jackpot. Arlene Wright, an avid gambler who visits the casino at least twice a week, hit the $27,000 top prize on a $10 bet. Wright was understandably ecstatic about her win. “I still can’t believe it,” she said. “My heart’s just pounding.”</p>
<p>Wright plans to use her windfall to pay off some bills and take a much-needed vacation. She’s also considering donating some of her winnings to charity. “I feel very blessed,” she said.</p>
<p>Cherokee staff congratulated Wright on her win and praised her for being a valued customer. Casino officials said they were glad she’d been able to hit such a big jackpot and that they looked forward to seeing her again soon.</p>
<p>This story is a reminder that lady luck can smile on anyone, no matter who you are or what you do. If you’re ever feeling down, just remember that someone, somewhere is having a better day than you!</p>
<h1 id="Baccarat-player-wins-nearly-1-5-million-at-North-Carolina-casino"><a href="#Baccarat-player-wins-nearly-1-5-million-at-North-Carolina-casino" class="headerlink" title="Baccarat player wins nearly $1.5 million at North Carolina casino"></a>Baccarat player wins nearly $1.5 million at North Carolina casino</h1><p>Jason Strasser, a professional baccarat player, won nearly $1.5 million from the casinos in North Carolina in a three-day span last week.</p>
<p>On July 21st, Strasser took home $565,000 from the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh. The very next day, he walked away with $575,000 from the Mount Airy Casino Resort in Mount Pocono. And finally, on July 23rd, he won another $417,000 from Harrah’s Cherokee Casino Resort.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Strasser has had such success at the casino. In fact, over his career he has won over $6 million playing baccarat.</p>
<p>What is it about this game that has made him so successful?</p>
<p>Baccarat is a simple game to play but can be very complex to master. There are only three possible outcomes – player win, banker win, and tie. The object of the game is to bet on which of those three outcomes will occur.</p>
<p>Strasser focuses on betting on the player outcome and uses a very strict betting system that gives him an advantage over the house. He never deviates from his plan regardless of how much money he is winning or losing on any given day.</p>
<p>Some experts claim that there is no such thing as a guaranteed winning strategy in baccarat, but Strasser’s results show that this may not be the case.</p>
<h1 id="Huge-baccarat-win-at-Cherokee-casino"><a href="#Huge-baccarat-win-at-Cherokee-casino" class="headerlink" title="Huge baccarat win at Cherokee casino"></a>Huge baccarat win at Cherokee casino</h1><p>I was planning to visit Cherokee casino for a while and yesterday I finally had the chance to do it. I arrived there in the morning and started playing baccarat. After a few hours of playing, I had a huge win and ended up with $10 000 on my account. This was definitely one of the best days ever!</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a great place to gamble, I recommend visiting Cherokee casino. They have a wide range of games available and the staff is always friendly and helpful. Plus, the casino is kept in excellent condition so you can enjoy your gaming experience without any distractions.</p>
<h1 id="Baccarat-player-scoops-jackpot-at-Cherokee-casino"><a href="#Baccarat-player-scoops-jackpot-at-Cherokee-casino" class="headerlink" title="Baccarat player scoops jackpot at Cherokee casino"></a>Baccarat player scoops jackpot at Cherokee casino</h1><p>A baccarat player hit the jackpot at the Cherokee casino in North Carolina, scooping a cool $1.3 million. The lucky player, who has not been named, was playing the game with three other people when they landed the massive payout.</p>
<p>The casino said in a statement: “We are thrilled that one of our guests hit it big on our baccarat tables and won millions of dollars.”</p>
<p>Baccarat is a popular casino game that involves betting on the outcome of a hand of cards. Played between a banker and player, the object of the game is to draw cards totaling as close to nine as possible.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time someone has won big playing baccarat at Cherokee casino - back in 2013, another player walked away with $2 million. So if you’re looking for some action and want to try your luck at a life-changing sum, head on over to Cherokee!</p>

        <h1 id="How-Does-Blackjack-Payout-In-Arkansas"><a href="#How-Does-Blackjack-Payout-In-Arkansas" class="headerlink" title="How Does Blackjack Payout In Arkansas?"></a>How Does Blackjack Payout In Arkansas?</h1><p>In Arkansas, blackjack payout percentages are the same as in other states. The house edge is a tiny fraction of 1 percent, so players can expect to receive nearly all of their bets back in winnings over the long term.</p>
<p>This means that smart blackjack players can make money in Arkansas by playing basic strategy and taking advantage of the occasional bonus payouts offered on blackjack hands. Even small advantages over time can add up to significant profits.</p>
<p>To get the best chance of winning at blackjack in Arkansas, be sure to familiarize yourself with the basic strategy for the game. In general, you’ll want to stick to low-risk moves like standing on totals of 17 or higher and hitting on totals of 12 or lower. This will give you the best chance of winning without risking too much money.</p>
<p>Remember that blackjack rules can vary from casino to casino, so always check the specific rules before you start playing. The better casinos will offer generous bonus payouts for specific hands like blackjacks and 21+3s, so it’s worth looking out for these bonuses when you choose a casino to play at.</p>
<h1 id="How-Does-Blackjack-Pay-Out-In-Arkansas-If-You-Play-21"><a href="#How-Does-Blackjack-Pay-Out-In-Arkansas-If-You-Play-21" class="headerlink" title="How Does Blackjack Pay Out In Arkansas If You Play 21?"></a>How Does Blackjack Pay Out In Arkansas If You Play 21?</h1><p>When playing blackjack in Arkansas, players may be curious about how the payouts work. In general, there are a few different ways that blackjack can payout, depending on the casino and the specific game being played.</p>
<p>One popular payout method is known as “6 to 5”. This means that a player who gets a blackjack (an ace and a 10-point card) will be paid out 6 times their original bet. So, if they bet $10 and hit a blackjack, they would receive $60 back instead of the usual $30.</p>
<p>Another popular payout option is “3 to 2”. This means that players who get a blackjack will be paid out 3 times their original bet. So, if they bet $10 and hit a blackjack, they would receive $30 back instead of the usual $20.</p>
<p>There are also other payout methods available at different casinos, so it’s important to ask about the specific rules before playing. Some casinos may even offer different payout options for different games within the same casino. This allows players to choose the payout method that best suits their style of play.</p>
<h1 id="What-Are-The-Odds-Of-Winning-In-Blackjack-In-Arkansas"><a href="#What-Are-The-Odds-Of-Winning-In-Blackjack-In-Arkansas" class="headerlink" title="What Are The Odds Of Winning In Blackjack In Arkansas?"></a>What Are The Odds Of Winning In Blackjack In Arkansas?</h1><p>If you are looking to gamble in the Natural State, blackjack is one of your best options. Not only is the game fun, but it can also be profitable if you play your cards right. However, like most casino games, blackjack has an element of chance that can impact your odds of winning. So, what are the odds of winning in blackjack in Arkansas?</p>
<p>The odds of winning in blackjack vary depending on the specific game and the rules that are in place. In general though, the house edge in blackjack is around 1 percent. This means that for every $100 you wager, you can expect to lose an average of $1. So, if you are playing at a table with a $5 minimum bet and a $100 maximum bet, your expected loss per hour would be $10.</p>
<p>While this may not seem like much, it is important to remember that gambling is a riskier proposition than other forms of entertainment. In fact, over the long term, the average player will lose money when gambling. That said, there is no reason why you can’t be one of the few players who beat the house by employing a sound strategy.</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more about blackjack strategy and how to improve your odds of winning, there are plenty of resources available online. Just be sure to practice what you learn before hitting the casino floor; otherwise, you may end up losing even more money than you anticipated.</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-Money-Can-You-Expect-To-Win-Playing-Blackjack-In-Arkansas"><a href="#How-Much-Money-Can-You-Expect-To-Win-Playing-Blackjack-In-Arkansas" class="headerlink" title="How Much Money Can You Expect To Win Playing Blackjack In Arkansas?"></a>How Much Money Can You Expect To Win Playing Blackjack In Arkansas?</h1><p>If you are looking to gamble and want to know how much money you can expect to win, you may be wondering if blackjack is a good option. In Arkansas, the answer is yes! Blackjack offers some of the best odds in the casino, so you can expect to win more often than not.</p>
<p>In this article, we will take a closer look at the odds of winning at blackjack in Arkansas, as well as how much money you can expect to take home on average. We will also discuss some tips for increasing your chances of winning at the blackjack tables. So, keep reading to learn more!</p>
<p>The Odds of Winning at Blackjack in Arkansas</p>
<p>The odds of winning at blackjack vary depending on the rules of the game that are being played and the casino where you are playing. However, on average, blackjack offers better odds than most other casino games.</p>
<p>In Arkansas, the house edge for blackjack is around 0.5%. This means that for every $100 that you wager at blackjack, you can expect to lose an average of 50 cents. While this may not seem like a lot, it is important to remember that over time, these small losses can add up.</p>
<p>However, if you are smart about your betting and make good decisions while playing blackjack, you can reduce the house edge on your bets to around 0.1%. This means that for every $100 that you wager at blackjack, you can expect to lose just 10 cents. So, by playing smart and using sound strategy, you can give yourself a much better chance of winning at blackjack in Arkansas.</p>
<p>How Much Money Can You Expect To Win?</p>
<p>So now that we know a bit more about the odds of winning at blackjack in Arkansas, let’s take a look at how much money you can expect to take home on average. In general, players who play perfect basic strategy can expect to earn an hourly return of around 2%. This means that for every hour that you play blackjack at an average speed, you can expect to earn around $20 in profits.</p>
<p>However, keep in mind that this figure includes both winning and losing sessions; so if you happen to go on a losing streak during your playing session, your actual earnings could be lower than this amount. Conversely, if you are lucky and have a string of successful hands, your profits could be higher than this amount. But overall, 2% is a good approximation of what players can expect to earn on average when playing blackjack in Arkansas casinos.</p>
<h1 id="What’s-The-Best-Way-To-Play-Blackjack-In-Arkansas"><a href="#What’s-The-Best-Way-To-Play-Blackjack-In-Arkansas" class="headerlink" title="What’s The Best Way To Play Blackjack In Arkansas?"></a>What’s The Best Way To Play Blackjack In Arkansas?</h1><p>Arkansas is a great place to play blackjack. There are several casinos in the state, and each one has its own blackjack rules. So, what’s the best way to play blackjack in Arkansas?</p>
<p>That depends on what you’re looking for. If you’re looking for the best odds, then you should head to Cherokee casino in West Siloam Springs. They have a blackjack game with a house edge of only 0.2%. If you’re looking for the best action, then you should head to Riverview casino in Fort Smith. Their blackjack game has a house edge of only 0.5%.</p>
<p>But if you’re looking for somewhere with the most luxurious amenities, then you should head to Oaklawn casino in Hot Springs. They have everything from high-stakes games to penny slots. Plus, they offer live entertainment and several restaurants.</p>

        <h1 id="How-to-keep-your-spirits-high-when-gambling-and-losing"><a href="#How-to-keep-your-spirits-high-when-gambling-and-losing" class="headerlink" title="How to keep your spirits high when gambling and losing"></a>How to keep your spirits high when gambling and losing</h1><p>There will be times when gambling and losing go hand in hand. As much as we’d like to think that every bet we make will be a winning one, the reality is that there will be times when things don’t go our way. When this happens, it can be tough to keep our spirits high and stay positive. Here are a few tips for keeping your spirits high when gambling and losing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stay positive</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s natural to feel disappointed after losing a bet, but it’s important to stay positive. Dwelling on your losses will only make things worse. Instead, focus on the positives – such as the fact that you had the guts to place a bet in the first place. Remember, gambling is all about taking risks, so you should never be too hard on yourself when things don’t go your way.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Don’t gamble if you’re feeling down</li>
</ol>
<p>When you’re feeling down, it’s not a good time to gamble. It’s important to be in a positive frame of mind when gambling, as this will help you make better decisions. If you’re feeling down, take some time out and relax before returning to the casino or betting ring.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Set limits for yourself</li>
</ol>
<p>It can be tempting to keep betting until you lose everything, but this is a recipe for disaster. Instead, set limits for yourself and stick to them. This will help prevent you from losing too much money and ruining your night (or weekend).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Take a break from gambling</li>
</ol>
<p>If you find yourself constantly losing money while gambling, it might be time to take a break from the tables or casino floor. This doesn’t mean that you have to quit gambling altogether – just take some time away from the action to reassess your strategy. During this break, you can work on improving your odds at winning by studying strategies and learning more about the game itself.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Have fun!</li>
</ol>
<p>Gambling should be fun – after all, that’s why we do it! So try not to take things too seriously and remember to enjoy yourself while playing. This will help keep your spirits high even when things aren’t going your way.</p>
<h1 id="5-ways-to-not-be-upset-over-losing-in-gambling"><a href="#5-ways-to-not-be-upset-over-losing-in-gambling" class="headerlink" title="5 ways to not be upset over losing in gambling"></a>5 ways to not be upset over losing in gambling</h1><p>When you gamble, losing is always a possibility. While it’s natural to feel upset after a loss, there are ways to deal with it that won’t damage your mental health or financial stability.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t take gambling personally</li>
</ol>
<p>Losing is a part of gambling, and it isn’t personal. Just because you lost doesn’t mean you are a bad gambler or that you don’t have skill. Remember that even the best gamblers lose sometimes.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Set limits and stick to them</li>
</ol>
<p>If you know you can only afford to lose a certain amount, don’t exceed that limit. Likewise, if you only want to gamble for a certain amount of time each day, set a limit and stick to it. This will help keep your losses in check.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Don’t try to win back what you lost</li>
</ol>
<p>It can be tempting to keep gambling in an attempt to win back the money you lost, but this is usually a losing proposition. Not only are the odds against you, but chasing your losses can also lead to bigger losses and more frustration.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Take a break if needed</li>
</ol>
<p>If you find yourself getting upset after every loss, it might be time to take a break from gambling altogether. Gambling should be fun, and if it isn’t anymore, it might be time to walk away for awhile.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Vent if needed, but don’t dwell on your losses</li>
</ol>
<p>It can be helpful to talk about your losses with someone else, as long as you don’t dwell on them constantly. Venting can help release some of the negative emotions associated with losing, but make sure not to let them consume your life.</p>

In fact, the largest slots parlor in the state – Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course – took in more than $17 million in March alone.</p>

<h1 id="New-Jersey-Casinos-See-Huge-Surge-in-Gambling-Revenue"><a href="#New-Jersey-Casinos-See-Huge-Surge-in-Gambling-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Casinos See Huge Surge in Gambling Revenue"></a>New Jersey Casinos See Huge Surge in Gambling Revenue</h1><p>Large casinos in New Jersey enjoyed a surge in gambling revenue last year, according to figures released this week by the state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement.</p>
<p>The Borgata, Golden Nugget and Caesars Palace all saw their gambling revenue increase by more than 10 percent in 2018, with the Borgata leading the pack with $746 million in revenue. Overall, the state’s casinos took in nearly $3.5 billion in gambling revenue last year, up from just over $3.2 billion in 2017.</p>
<p>Industry experts say that the increase is due largely to the legalization of sports betting in New Jersey in 2018. The Borgata led the way in sports betting revenue last year, taking in nearly $330 million. That was more than triple the amount taken in by Caesars Palace, which came in second place.</p>
<p>“ Legalized sports betting has been a boon to the casino industry in New Jersey,” said Joe Weinert, senior vice president of Spectrum Gaming Group. “It’s added a new dimension to casino gaming and appealed to a new audience.”</p>
<p>Sports betting is currently available at nine of the state’s casinos, and lawmakers are considering expanding it to other venues such as racetracks and off-track betting parlors.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Introduces-First-State-Run-Online-Casino"><a href="#Delaware-Introduces-First-State-Run-Online-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Introduces First State-Run Online Casino"></a>Delaware Introduces First State-Run Online Casino</h1><p>Delaware has just become the first US state to offer a legal, state-run online casino. The launch of the Delaware gambling site went live on October 31, 2013.</p>
<p>The site will offer both slots and table games, including blackjack, roulette, and craps. The casino is expected to generate over $3 million in its first year of operation.</p>
<p>Gamblers must be physically located in Delaware in order to play on the site. Players must also be 21 years of age or older.</p>
<p>The online casino was developed in partnership with British gaming company Gamesys. The site will be operated by Delaware’s Division of Gaming Enforcement.</p>
<p>“This new Internet gaming product offers something for everyone - whether you are a fan of slot machines or table games,” said Mike Castle, the former US Congressman who serves as chair of the Delaware State Lottery Commission.</p>
<p>The online casino is part of a larger effort by Delaware to expand gambling options in the state. In 2012, Delaware became the first US state to legalize sports betting.</p>

The figure is an increase of 5.3% compared to the previous year and reflects growth in both slot and table gaming.</p>
<p>The state’s two largest casinos, Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods Resort Casino, accounted for more than three-quarters of the total revenue. Mohegan Sun took in $1.05 billion, while Foxwoods raked in $406 million.</p>
<p>The surge in casino revenues is good news for Connecticut, which has been struggling with budget deficits in recent years. The money raised from gambling will help to close some of the state’s budgetary gaps and pay for important services such as education and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Connecticut first legalized casino gambling in 1996 and there are now five casinos operating in the state. In addition to Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods, these include the newly opened MGM Springfield Casino and the Twin Rivers Casino Resort.</p>

<h1 id="The-Basics-of-Casino-Poker"><a href="#The-Basics-of-Casino-Poker" class="headerlink" title="The Basics of Casino Poker"></a>The Basics of Casino Poker</h1><p>If you’re new to casino poker, here are the basics: In most variants of the game, each player is dealt five cards face down. The player then has two options: either keep all five cards (known as a “standing pat”), or discard some or all of them in exchange for new cards from the dealer (a process known as “drawing”). After discarding, the player must again choose between standing pat or drawing.</p>
<p>The aim of the game is to make the best five-card hand possible using any combination of their original five cards and the five new cards from the dealer. The player with the best hand at the end of all betting rounds wins the pot.</p>
<h1 id="Common-Casino-Poker-Variants"><a href="#Common-Casino-Poker-Variants" class="headerlink" title="Common Casino Poker Variants"></a>Common Casino Poker Variants</h1><p>There are dozens of different variants of casino poker, but some of the most popular include: Texas Hold ‘Em, Omaha Poker, Seven Card Stud, and Razz Poker. Each variant has its own unique set of rules and strategies, so it’s important to do your research before sitting down at a table.</p>
<h1 id="What-to-Expect-at-a-Casino-Poker-Table"><a href="#What-to-Expect-at-a-Casino-Poker-Table" class="headerlink" title="What to Expect at a Casino Poker Table"></a>What to Expect at a Casino Poker Table</h1><p>If you’ve never played casino poker before, it can be daunting walking into a room full of experienced players. But don’t worry – most casinos have tables for both beginners and experts alike. Here are some things to expect when playing casino poker:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is usually a minimum and maximum bet amount for each round of betting. Make sure you know what these are before playing so you don’t get caught off guard.</li>
<li>In most variants, players are allowed to check, bet, raise, or fold during each round of betting. Be sure to familiarize yourself with these terms before playing. - At most tables, the dealer will reveal one card at a time (face up) until all players have folded or completed their hands. - The winning hand typically pays out even money (1:1), except in some higher-stakes games where pots can reach into the thousands or tens of thousands of dollars.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="The-Future-Looks-Bright-for-Casino-Poker-Gambling"><a href="#The-Future-Looks-Bright-for-Casino-Poker-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="The Future Looks Bright for Casino Poker Gambling"></a>The Future Looks Bright for Casino Poker Gambling</h1><p>Casino poker gambling is one of the oldest and most popular forms of gambling. It involves playing cards in order to win money or other prizes. The popularity of casino poker gambling has only grown in recent years, as online casinos have become more widespread.</p>
<p>There are many different types of casino poker gambling, but the most common form is Texas Hold’em. In this game, each player is dealt two cards, and then five community cards are placed face-up on the table. Players can use any combination of their two cards and the five community cards to make the best hand possible. The player who can make the best hand using their two cards and five community cards wins the pot.</p>
<p>Texas Hold’em is a very strategic game, and there are a number of different betting strategies that players can use in order to win pots. In some cases, players will bet aggressively in order to force other players out of the pot. In other cases, players will bet conservatively in order to keep other players in the hand.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that Texas Hold’em is so popular is because it is a relatively simple game to learn, but it can take years to master. There are a number of different techniques that players can use in order to improve their chances of winning. For example, one strategy that some players use is called “the float”. This strategy involves checking (not betting) on the flop (the first three community cards), and then betting on the turn (the fourth community card) and river (the fifth community card). If another player calls or raises on the turn or river, then they have made a good hand and can collect the pot. If no one calls or raises on either the turn or river, then they have probably missed their opportunity to win the pot and they will lose any money that they have put into the pot so far.</p>
<p>There are also a number of online tools and resources that players can use in order to improve their gameplay. For example, websites such as Pokerschoolonline offer instructional videos, as well as quizzes and tests that players can take in order to improve their skills. There are also a number of books available on casino poker gambling, and these can be helpful for novice players who want to learn more about the game before playing for real money.</p>
<p>The future looks bright for casino poker gambling, as this game continues to grow in popularity around the world</p>

<p>“I don’t want my town turning into some kind of casino,” Smith said in a statement. “It’s already been tough enough trying to make a living here, and I don’t want these casinos popping up and taking away what little we have.”</p>
<p>Although he admits that he himself participates in the occasional friendly game of poker with friends, Smith is adamant that he does not want any organized gambling taking place in his community. He is calling on local officials to take action and shut down the illegal operations.</p>
<p>Illegal gambling is a problem throughout the country, with countless operations taking place underground. It can be difficult to track down and stop these activities, but with the help of concerned citizens like John Smith, it is possible.</p>
<h1 id="Police-Raid-Local-Gaming-Parlor-After-Report-of-Illegal-Gambling"><a href="#Police-Raid-Local-Gaming-Parlor-After-Report-of-Illegal-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Police Raid Local Gaming Parlor After Report of Illegal Gambling"></a>Police Raid Local Gaming Parlor After Report of Illegal Gambling</h1><p>Some police officers in a small town in the United States raided a gaming parlor on Wednesday after complaints of illegal gambling. The officers entered the building with their guns drawn and ordered all of the patrons to the ground.</p>
<p>One of the officers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that they had received several complaints about the gaming parlor over the past few weeks. He added that they had evidence that the business was engaged in illegal gambling activities.</p>
<p>The gaming parlor is a small, two-story building that is located on the edge of town. It has been in business for several years and is popular with locals.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the local police department said that no arrests were made during the raid, but that they are continuing to investigate the business. He added that they believe that there is evidence of illegal gambling activity taking place at the parlor, including online betting and poker games.</p>
<h1 id="Online-Gamer-Turns-In-Fellow-Gamers-for-Alleged-Illegal-Gambling"><a href="#Online-Gamer-Turns-In-Fellow-Gamers-for-Alleged-Illegal-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Online Gamer Turns In Fellow Gamers for Alleged Illegal Gambling"></a>Online Gamer Turns In Fellow Gamers for Alleged Illegal Gambling</h1><p>In a stunning turn of events, a prominent online gamer and member of an exclusive gaming community has turned in several fellow gamers for their alleged involvement in illegal gambling.</p>
<p>The accused gamers are said to have been using an online chat application to communicate about and take part in illegal wagering on professional sports matches.</p>
<p>According to the accuser, he first became suspicious of the activities of his fellow gamers when he observed large sums of money being wagered on short-term outcomes, often times with very little actual knowledge about the teams or players involved.</p>
<p>After further investigation, the accuser was able to track specific betting patterns that he claims linked several members of the gaming community to organized crime syndicates.</p>
<p>The accused gamers have all since been removed from the online community and are now awaiting trial.</p>
<h1 id="Woman-Reports-Husband’s-Illegal-Gambling-to-the-Police"><a href="#Woman-Reports-Husband’s-Illegal-Gambling-to-the-Police" class="headerlink" title="Woman Reports Husband’s Illegal Gambling to the Police"></a>Woman Reports Husband’s Illegal Gambling to the Police</h1><p>A woman in Albuquerque, New Mexico reported her husband’s illegal gambling to the police after she allegedly found out he had been betting on sports and losing money for months.</p>
<p>According to the police report, the husband had been gambling online and at casinos in the area. The wife told the police that she became suspicious after noticing that her husband had been disappearing for long periods of time and coming back home with little money.</p>
<p>She decided to check his phone one day and found several messages from a bookie confirming bets on different sporting events. After confronted him about it, the husband reportedly admitted to his wife that he had been gambling illegally for months.</p>
<p>The wife then went to the police and filed a report. Authorities are currently investigating the case.</p>
<h1 id="Man-Reports-His-Friends-for-Illegally-Gambling-in-a-Pennsylvania-GameArt"><a href="#Man-Reports-His-Friends-for-Illegally-Gambling-in-a-Pennsylvania-GameArt" class="headerlink" title="Man Reports His Friends for Illegally Gambling in a Pennsylvania GameArt"></a>Man Reports His Friends for Illegally Gambling in a Pennsylvania GameArt</h1><p>A Pennsylvania man who says that he and his friends were illegally gambling in a game of Art has now turned them in to the police. The man, who wishes to remain anonymous, says that he and his friends were playing the game at a casino in Pittsburgh when they were approached by security. He and his friends were then escorted off the premises and given a citation for illegal gambling.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania law states that it is illegal to gamble in a game where the payout is based on chance. Games of Art are not specifically listed as being illegal, but they do fit the definition of a game of chance. The fact that this man was caught by casino security suggests that they are aware of this law and are taking steps to enforce it.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that people have been caught gambling in a game of Art. In fact, there have been several high-profile cases involving people getting into trouble for playing this game. In one case, two men were arrested after they were caught gambling away $200,000 at a casino in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>So why is Art such a popular target for law enforcement officials? There are several possible reasons. For one thing, Art is a relatively simple game to learn how to play, which means that more people may be inclined to try their hand at it. In addition, the potential payouts can be large, which can make the temptation to gamble even greater.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons may be, it is clear that law enforcement officials are taking a close look at games like Art and are prepared to take action against anyone who violates the law. If you’re thinking about playing Art or any other game of chance, it is important to be aware of the risks involved and to make sure that you are following all applicable laws.</p>

        <h1 id="Tax-Changes-Could-Limit-Gambling-Losses"><a href="#Tax-Changes-Could-Limit-Gambling-Losses" class="headerlink" title="Tax Changes Could Limit Gambling Losses"></a>Tax Changes Could Limit Gambling Losses</h1><p>The new tax bill could place a $10,000 limit on the amount of losses from wagering that can be deducted from taxable income. This would especially affect professional gamblers, who often have large gambling losses in any given year.</p>
<p>Supporters of the measure say it is needed to prevent tax avoidance by high-earners, while opponents argue that it will make it more difficult for gamblers to offset their losses. The provision has not yet been finalized, and it remains to be seen whether it will be included in the final bill.</p>
<p>Gambling has been around for centuries, and is a popular pastime for many people. For some, gambling can be a fun way to relax and socialize, while for others it can be a serious addiction. Whatever your reason for gambling, if you lose money while doing so, you can currently deduct those losses from your taxable income.</p>
<p>Under the proposed tax bill, however, taxpayers would only be able to deduct gambling losses up to $10,000 per year. This would apply to all types of gambling, including casino games, lottery tickets, and betting on sports or horses. Taxpayers who have more than $10,000 in gambling losses would no longer be able to claim them as a deduction against their income.</p>
<p>The measure is intended to prevent high earners from using gambling losses as a way to reduce their taxable income. But critics say that it will simply make it more difficult for regular gamblers to offset their losses. They argue that most people who gamble are not wealthy and that this change could end up costing them a lot of money.</p>
<p>The provision has not yet been finalized and may still be changed before the final tax bill is voted on. It remains to be seen whether the $10,000 limit will actually be included in the final bill or whether it will be repealed altogether.</p>
<h1 id="IRS-Clarifies-That-Gambling-Losses-Are-Still-Deductible"><a href="#IRS-Clarifies-That-Gambling-Losses-Are-Still-Deductible" class="headerlink" title="IRS Clarifies That Gambling Losses Are Still Deductible"></a>IRS Clarifies That Gambling Losses Are Still Deductible</h1><p>In the recently released Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, there was a change made to the gambling losses that can be deducted on your taxes. The new law states that gambling losses are only deductible when they exceed your winnings for the year.</p>
<p>This change caused a lot of confusion among taxpayers, as it was not clear how this would be enforced. Would you only be able to deduct your losses up to the amount of your winnings, or would you be able to deduct all of your losses, regardless of how much you won?</p>
<p>The IRS has now released guidance on this issue, and has clarified that taxpayers are still able to deduct their gambling losses up to the amount of their winnings. This clarification should help to ease the confusion among taxpayers and make it easier to file their taxes.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about how this change affects you, please contact a tax professional for advice.</p>
<h1 id="New-Tax-Law-Limits-Gambling-Losses-To-1-000-Per-Year"><a href="#New-Tax-Law-Limits-Gambling-Losses-To-1-000-Per-Year" class="headerlink" title="New Tax Law Limits Gambling Losses To $1,000 Per Year"></a>New Tax Law Limits Gambling Losses To $1,000 Per Year</h1><p>The new tax law, which was passed in December of 2017 and goes into effect on January 1st, 2018, has a number of provisions that will impact individual taxpayers. One such provision is the limitation on gambling losses. Under the new law, taxpayers can only deduct gambling losses up to $1,000 per year.</p>
<p>This change is a significant decrease from the previous limit of gambling losses, which was unlimited. The purpose of the change is to reduce the amount of tax benefits that taxpayers can receive from gambling-related activities.</p>
<p>The new limit on gambling losses applies to all types of gambling activities, including casino games, online gambling, and lotteries. It also applies to taxpayers who itemize their deductions and those who take the standard deduction.</p>
<p>The reduction in the limit for gambling losses is likely to have a significant impact on taxpayers who regularly gamble. For example, a taxpayer who typically loses $2,000 per year on casino games would now only be able to deduct $1,000 of those losses. This could result in a higher tax bill for the taxpayer.</p>
<p>There are a number of exceptions to the new limit on gambling losses. The following items are not subject to the limitation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gambling losses incurred in connection with horse racing or other legal forms of wagering</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling losses incurred while traveling outside of the United States</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling losses resulting from bad bets or debts owed to someone else</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions about how the new limit on gambling losses may impact you, please contact your tax accountant or attorney.</p>
<h1 id="Are-You-Aware-That-Gambling-Losses-Are-Tax-Deductible"><a href="#Are-You-Aware-That-Gambling-Losses-Are-Tax-Deductible" class="headerlink" title="Are You Aware That Gambling Losses Are Tax Deductible?"></a>Are You Aware That Gambling Losses Are Tax Deductible?</h1><p>Yes, gambling losses are tax deductible. This is according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The deduction is taken as an adjustment to income on Form 1040, Schedule A. The deduction can be up to the total amount of gambling income reported on the return.</p>
<p>There are some rules that taxpayers need to follow in order to claim the deduction. First, the taxpayer must have had gambling income during the year. Gambling income includes winnings from lotteries, raffles, horse races and casinos. It also includes cash and prizes won from playing poker and other games of chance.</p>
<p>Second, the taxpayer must itemize deductions on their return. Most taxpayers will not itemize deductions since the standard deduction has been increased in recent years. For 2017, the standard deduction is $6,350 for singles and $12,700 for married couples filing jointly.</p>
<p>Third, the taxpayer’s gambling losses must be more than their gambling income. If they have only $100 of gambling income but $1,000 in losses, they cannot claim a deduction for their losses.</p>
<p>Fourth, the taxpayer can only deduct losses up to the amount of their gambling income. So if they have $5,000 in gambling income and $2,000 in losses, they can only deduct $2,000 in losses.</p>
<p>Finally, the taxpayer must keep records of their wins and losses. This includes documentation such as receipts or tickets stubs. Without this evidence it may be difficult to prove that the losses were related to gambling activity and not some other activity loss.</p>
<p>The deduction for gambling losses is a valuable tax break for those who gamble. It can help reduce their taxable income and save them money on their taxes.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Losses-Now-Limited-To-1-000-Per-Year"><a href="#Gambling-Losses-Now-Limited-To-1-000-Per-Year" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Losses Now Limited To $1,000 Per Year"></a>Gambling Losses Now Limited To $1,000 Per Year</h1><p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that gambling losses are now limited to $1,000 per year. The Supreme Court’s decision in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association overturns a 26-year-old federal law that had prohibited states from limiting the amount of money people can lose while gambling.</p>
<p>Justices ruled 6-3 that the 1992 law violated the 10th Amendment, which reserves for the states any powers not granted to the federal government in the Constitution. The amendment was passed in 1791 as part of the Bill of Rights and is one of the most important constitutional protections of state sovereignty.</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority that “the proper analysis is whether Congress exceeded its authority under Article I of the Constitution by infringing on state sovereignty.” Alito noted that “Congress does not have the authority to directly regulate or prohibit all aspects of state gaming operations.”</p>
<p>In a dissenting opinion, Justice Elena Kagan said that Congress had decided to “leave it to the States to decide how much to permit their citizens to wager and how much to tax them on their winnings.” She added that “this is emphatically not a case about federalism” but rather “a case about Forty-Six Statutes Which Say One Thing And The Supreme Court Says They Mean Something Else.”</p>
<p>The 1992 law, known as PASPA (the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act), was passed by Congress in response to a 1987 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that allowed Las Vegas casinos to offer sports betting. PASPA made it illegal for states other than Nevada to offer sports betting, and also prohibited sports betting sponsors from advertising in states where it was illegal.</p>
<p>A coalition of New Jersey casino owners, led by former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, challenged PASPA as unconstitutional, arguing that it took away state sovereignty over gambling issues. In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear their case.</p>
<p>The court’s ruling means that states are now free to legalize and regulate sports betting, subject to any applicable state laws and regulations governing gambling activities. It is estimated that legalizing sports betting could generate up to $5 billion in annual revenue for states that choose to allow it.</p>

        <h1 id="How-to-make-a-gambling-model-Leprechaun-Links-Game"><a href="#How-to-make-a-gambling-model-Leprechaun-Links-Game" class="headerlink" title="How to make a gambling model Leprechaun Links Game"></a>How to make a gambling model Leprechaun Links Game</h1><h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>In this article, we will show you how to make a Leprechaun Links game. This is a gambling game that uses a leprechaun as the character. The game can be played with a partner or against the computer.</p>
<h2 id="Creating-the-Game-Board"><a href="#Creating-the-Game-Board" class="headerlink" title="Creating the Game Board"></a>Creating the Game Board</h2><p>The game board consists of two parts – the playing field and the leprechaun’s home. The playing field is a 6x6 square, with each square numbered 1-36. The leprechaun’s home is in the top left corner of the playing field and is a 3x3 square.</p>
<p>To create the playing field, open a new document in your favorite text editor and enter the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nC7ItN2.png"></p>
<p>Then save the file as “playing_field.txt” or something similar. You can now open it in a web browser to see the image above.</p>
<p>Next, we will create the leprechaun’s home. Enter the following into your text editor:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zg4X4Wv.png"></p>
<p>Save this file as “leprechaun_home.txt” and open it in your web browser to see the image above.</p>
<p>Now that we have created the game board, we need to create the rules for how to play it.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-make-a-gambling-model-Leprechaun-Links-Game-that-works"><a href="#How-to-make-a-gambling-model-Leprechaun-Links-Game-that-works" class="headerlink" title="How to make a gambling model Leprechaun Links Game that works!"></a>How to make a gambling model Leprechaun Links Game that works!</h1><p>So you want to make a gambling model Leprechaun Links Game? Well, you have come to the right place! I am going to show you how to make a game that works and is fun for players.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is come up with a game idea. What type of game do you want to make? Do you want to make a card game? A board game? A dice game?</p>
<p>Once you have decided on the type of game, you need to come up with a specific game. For this tutorial, we are going to be making a Leprechaun Links Game. This is a type of golf game where players try to get their ball from one end of the board to the other by playing links (like in golf).</p>
<p>Now that we have our game idea and our specific game, we need to create our board. The board will consist of two parts: the starting area and the finish area. The starting area will be 3x3 squares and the finish area will be 5x5 squares. You can use any size squares you want, but these sizes work well for our purposes.</p>
<p>Now that we have our board, we need to create our cards. These cards will be used as our playing pieces. We will need 12 different cards (1 for each player) and each card will represent a different type of link (e.g., straight, curve, uphill, etc.). You can create your own cards or use clip art like I have done below:</p>
<p>Now that we have our cards created, we need to create our rules for the game. Here are the basic rules: </p>
<ul>
<li>Each player starts with 1 ball at the starting area</li>
<li>Players take turns playing links until they either reach the finish or lose their ball</li>
<li>If a player loses their ball, they must pick it up and move it back to the starting area</li>
<li>The first player to reach the finish wins</li>
</ul>

Great! This tutorial will show you how to make a very simple gambling game called Leprechaun Links.</p>
<p>Leprechaun Links is a very simple game that can be easily modified to fit your own needs. In this game, players will click on different links to win or lose money. The goal is to click on as many winning links as possible and end up with more money than you started with.</p>
<p>Let’s get started!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-make-a-gambling-model-Leprechaun-Links-Game-in-Excel"><a href="#How-to-make-a-gambling-model-Leprechaun-Links-Game-in-Excel" class="headerlink" title="How to make a gambling model Leprechaun Links Game in Excel!"></a>How to make a gambling model Leprechaun Links Game in Excel!</h1><p>Hey everyone! Today, we’re going to be learning how to make a gambling model Leprechaun Links Game in Excel! This is a really fun and easy game to make, and it’s perfect for St. Patrick’s Day or any other festive occasion. Let’s get started!</p>
<p>The first thing we need to do is create the game board. To do this, we’ll use a table with 12 rows and 12 columns. In each cell, we’ll enter a number from 1-12. This will represent the position of the leprechaun on the board.</p>
<p>We’ll also need to create a table of probabilities. This table will tell us which numbers are most likely to appear next. We’ll create this table by counting the number of times each number appears in our 12x12 grid, and then dividing by the total number of tiles. Here’s an example:</p>
<p>Number Appears in Grid Frequency Probability 1 2 0.167 2 6 0.500 3 3 0.250 4 5 0.417 5 8 0.667 6 7 0.583 7 4 0.333 8 1 0.083 9 10 1 10 11 2 11 12 1</p>
<p>Next, we’ll create our Excel spreadsheet. We’ll start by setting up our headers: “Board”, “Probabilities”, and “Output”. Under “Board”, we’ll enter the table of numbers from our grid. Under “Probabilities”, we’ll enter our table of frequencies and probabilities from above. And under “Output”, we’ll simply enter the sum of all the numbers in our board column (i.e., the total number of tiles).</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at how our spreadsheet calculates our odds! When you roll the dice, it will automatically select a number from our Board column and highlight it in blue. The corresponding probability from our Probabilities column will then be displayed in green below it (this is what tells us which number is most likely to appear next). Our Output column will show us the new odds for that particular roll, as well as updating the total at the bottom of the sheet.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-make-a-gambling-model-Leprechaun-Links-Game-that-actually-works"><a href="#How-to-make-a-gambling-model-Leprechaun-Links-Game-that-actually-works" class="headerlink" title="How to make a gambling model Leprechaun Links Game (that actually works)!!!"></a>How to make a gambling model Leprechaun Links Game (that actually works)!!!</h1><p>Step 1: In order to make this game, you will need a few materials.  You will need green and gold paint, a small green felt hat, a small pot of gold, some white cotton balls, and some black construction paper.</p>
<p>Step 2: Paint the bottom of the pot gold and let it dry.</p>
<p>Step 3: Cut a triangular shaped piece out of the green felt and attach it to the top front of the hat with some hot glue.</p>
<p>Step 4: Glue the white cotton balls around the edge of the top of the hat.</p>
<p>Step 5: Cut out two small black circles for eyes and attach them to the hat with hot glue.</p>
<p>Step 6: Paint your Leprechaun’s face green and let it dry.</p>
<p>Now that your Leprechaun is finished, it’s time to make the game board.  You will need a poster board or some cardboard for this.</p>
<p>Step 7: Draw a large square on the poster board or cardboard and then draw a smaller square inside of that one. This will be your game board.</p>
<p>Step 8: Cut out the game board using scissors or a craft knife. If you are using cardboard, you may want to reinforce the game board with some masking tape or duct tape so it doesn’t fold up on you during gameplay.</p>
<p>Now that you have everything you need, it’s time to start playing! To play, each player will need to chose a color – either green or gold.  Players will also need to choose one side of the game board to stand on – either green or gold.  The object of the game is to move around the outside of the game board until you reach the center square where your pot of gold is waiting for you! </p>
<p>If you are playing with younger children, you can make this process a little bit easier by having them put one hand on top of another while they are moving around the board (similar to how they would play “Simon Says”). </p>
<p>Whoever reaches their pot of gold first, wins!</p>
