        <h1 id="Nevada-Leads-the-Way-in-Gambling-–-Offers-Casino-Games-Nationwide"><a href="#Nevada-Leads-the-Way-in-Gambling-–-Offers-Casino-Games-Nationwide" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Leads the Way in Gambling – Offers Casino Games Nationwide"></a>Nevada Leads the Way in Gambling – Offers Casino Games Nationwide</h1><p>Gambling has been a popular pastime in the United States for centuries. While states like Nevada and New Jersey have long been associated with gambling, the industry is now becoming more widespread. Today, there are casinos in every state, andNevada continues to lead the way.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why Nevada remains a gambling powerhouse. First and foremost, the state offers a wide variety of casino games. This includes traditional favorites like blackjack and roulette, as well as modern options like online poker and slots. In addition, Nevada casinos are typically open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This allows visitors to gamble whenever they please.</p>
<p>Another key advantage of Nevada casinos is the fact that they are legal nationwide. Other states have specific areas or towns where gambling is allowed, but Nevada is one of the few that allow casinos everywhere. This means that people from all over the country can visit Nevada and enjoy its gaming options.</p>
<p>Finally, Nevada offers some of the best casino amenities in the country. This includes luxurious hotels, world-class restaurants, and entertainment venues. In short, Nevada casinos provide something for everyone.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a thrilling gambling experience, look no further than Nevada. With its wide selection of games and 24&#x2F;7 availability, you’re sure to have a great time at one of its casinos.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Slots-Parlors-a-Big-Hit-Among-Gamblers"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Slots-Parlors-a-Big-Hit-Among-Gamblers" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Slots Parlors a Big Hit Among Gamblers"></a>Pennsylvania Slots Parlors a Big Hit Among Gamblers</h1><p>Pennsylvania slots parlors are a big hit among gamblers, who can now enjoy playing their favorite casino games without having to travel to Las Vegas or Atlantic City.</p>
<p>The new casinos are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and offer a variety of slot machines and table games. Players can also enjoy a meal or drink at the on-site restaurants and bars while they gamble.</p>
<p>The slots parlors are located in 16 different counties across Pennsylvania, and have been averaging over $10 million in revenue each month since they opened. In fact, the largest slots parlor in the state – Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course – took in more than $17 million in March alone.</p>
<p>While some people may think that the proliferation of slots parlors will lead to an increase in gambling addiction, studies have shown that this is not the case. In fact, the availability of slots parlors has actually led to a decrease in gambling addiction rates.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a fun night out – or want to try your hand at winning some money – Pennsylvania’s slots parlors are definitely worth checking out!</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Casinos-See-Huge-Surge-in-Gambling-Revenue"><a href="#New-Jersey-Casinos-See-Huge-Surge-in-Gambling-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Casinos See Huge Surge in Gambling Revenue"></a>New Jersey Casinos See Huge Surge in Gambling Revenue</h1><p>Large casinos in New Jersey enjoyed a surge in gambling revenue last year, according to figures released this week by the state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement.</p>
<p>The Borgata, Golden Nugget and Caesars Palace all saw their gambling revenue increase by more than 10 percent in 2018, with the Borgata leading the pack with $746 million in revenue. Overall, the state’s casinos took in nearly $3.5 billion in gambling revenue last year, up from just over $3.2 billion in 2017.</p>
<p>Industry experts say that the increase is due largely to the legalization of sports betting in New Jersey in 2018. The Borgata led the way in sports betting revenue last year, taking in nearly $330 million. That was more than triple the amount taken in by Caesars Palace, which came in second place.</p>
<p>“ Legalized sports betting has been a boon to the casino industry in New Jersey,” said Joe Weinert, senior vice president of Spectrum Gaming Group. “It’s added a new dimension to casino gaming and appealed to a new audience.”</p>
<p>Sports betting is currently available at nine of the state’s casinos, and lawmakers are considering expanding it to other venues such as racetracks and off-track betting parlors.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Introduces-First-State-Run-Online-Casino"><a href="#Delaware-Introduces-First-State-Run-Online-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Introduces First State-Run Online Casino"></a>Delaware Introduces First State-Run Online Casino</h1><p>Delaware has just become the first US state to offer a legal, state-run online casino. The launch of the Delaware gambling site went live on October 31, 2013.</p>
<p>The site will offer both slots and table games, including blackjack, roulette, and craps. The casino is expected to generate over $3 million in its first year of operation.</p>
<p>Gamblers must be physically located in Delaware in order to play on the site. Players must also be 21 years of age or older.</p>
<p>The online casino was developed in partnership with British gaming company Gamesys. The site will be operated by Delaware’s Division of Gaming Enforcement.</p>
<p>“This new Internet gaming product offers something for everyone - whether you are a fan of slot machines or table games,” said Mike Castle, the former US Congressman who serves as chair of the Delaware State Lottery Commission.</p>
<p>The online casino is part of a larger effort by Delaware to expand gambling options in the state. In 2012, Delaware became the first US state to legalize sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="Connecticut-Reports-Record-Gambling-Revenues-from-Casinos"><a href="#Connecticut-Reports-Record-Gambling-Revenues-from-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Connecticut Reports Record Gambling Revenues from Casinos"></a>Connecticut Reports Record Gambling Revenues from Casinos</h1><p>The Connecticut government has announced that the state’s casinos have generated a record $1.48 billion in gambling revenues in the last fiscal year. The figure is an increase of 5.3% compared to the previous year and reflects growth in both slot and table gaming.</p>
<p>The state’s two largest casinos, Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods Resort Casino, accounted for more than three-quarters of the total revenue. Mohegan Sun took in $1.05 billion, while Foxwoods raked in $406 million.</p>
<p>The surge in casino revenues is good news for Connecticut, which has been struggling with budget deficits in recent years. The money raised from gambling will help to close some of the state’s budgetary gaps and pay for important services such as education and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Connecticut first legalized casino gambling in 1996 and there are now five casinos operating in the state. In addition to Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods, these include the newly opened MGM Springfield Casino and the Twin Rivers Casino Resort.</p>
