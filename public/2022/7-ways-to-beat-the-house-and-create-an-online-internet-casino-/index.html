<p>Before we get into the details, let’s take a quick look at the basics of creating an online casino. Here are the key things you need to do:</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>Create a high-quality website</li>
</ol>
<p>Your website is your casino’s face to the world, so it needs to look professional and polished. It should also be easy to navigate, so players can find what they’re looking for quickly and easily.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Choose a reliable gaming provider</li>
</ol>
<p>Not all gaming providers are created equal. When choosing a gaming provider for your casino, make sure you select one that offers quality games that are enjoyable to play. Bonus features such as jackpots and free spins are also a must-have.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Market your casino effectively</li>
