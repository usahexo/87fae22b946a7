The name was chosen by the team’s general manager and majority owner, Wayne Weaver.</p>
<p>Weaver explained his decision in a press conference shortly after the team’s founding. “We wanted a distinctive name that would be easy to remember and would capture the spirit of Jacksonville,” he said. “We also wanted something that would represent all of Duval County, from downtown to the beaches.”</p>
<p>Red88 is unique and easily recognizable and pays tribute to both the military history of Jacksonville and the county’s diversity.</p>

It is a color that can easily be seen from a distance, making it perfect for sporting events. Additionally, red has been scientifically proven to increase heart rates, giving spectators an adrenaline rush.</p>

The team has had a few name changes over the years, but their original name was the Jacksonville Jaguars. In 2009, the team announced that they would be changing their name to the “Jaguars”. They created a contest where fans could submit their ideas for a new team name, and the finalists were “Roadrunners”, “Flight”, “Heat”, “ Sharks “, and “ Bobcats “. The team finally decided on the “Jaguars” moniker, which was submitted by 7-year-old Cameron Schreiber.</p>
<h1 id="How-did-the-NHL-decide-on-their-team-names-and-colors"><a href="#How-did-the-NHL-decide-on-their-team-names-and-colors" class="headerlink" title="How did the NHL decide on their team names and colors?"></a>How did the NHL decide on their team names and colors?</h1><p>The NHL has a long and detailed history which helps to explain how they selected their team names and colors.</p>
<p>The Original Six teams were created in 1926 and they were the Boston Bruins, Chicago Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens, New York Rangers, and Toronto Maple Leafs. These six teams represented the largest and most influential hockey markets in North America at the time. The league didn’t expand again until 1967 when six new teams were added.</p>
<p>For the 1967 expansion, the league held a contest where fans could submit ideas for team names and colors. However, the only restriction was that no team could have the same name as an existing NHL franchise. Out of over 4,000 submissions, 17 finalists were chosen and put to a public vote. The winners were the California Golden Seals (name), Cleveland Barons (name), Philadelphia Flyers (colors), Pittsburgh Penguins (colors), St. Louis Blues (name), and Vancouver Canucks (name).</p>
<p>Since then, there have been a few other expansions and relocations but the process for naming new teams has basically remained the same. Fans submit name ideas and then a panel of judges consisting of NHL executives and marketing experts narrows it down to a shortlist of finalists. That list is then put to a public vote where the fans decide on the final team name and colors.</p>
<h1 id="Why-were-some-teams-and-colors-chosen-over-others"><a href="#Why-were-some-teams-and-colors-chosen-over-others" class="headerlink" title="Why were some teams and colors chosen over others?"></a>Why were some teams and colors chosen over others?</h1><p>One of the most frequently asked questions about the NFL is why some teams and colors were chosen over others. Some teams, like the Dallas Cowboys, are iconic and have been around for a long time. Others, like the Jacksonville Jaguars, don’t have as much history. So why were they chosen?</p>
<p>One theory is that it has to do with how well the colors look together on TV. The NFL is a business, and they want to make sure that all of their teams look good on TV. That’s why you’ll see teams like the Green Bay Packers and New England Patriots with traditional colors, while teams like the Los Angeles Rams and Jacksonville Jaguars have brighter colors.</p>
<p>Another theory is that it has to do with marketing. The NFL wants to appeal to as many people as possible, and they believe that certain colors will be more appealing to certain audiences. For example, blue is often seen as a calming color, so the Tennessee Titans might have chosen blue as their primary color because they wanted to appeal to fans in the South.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, nobody really knows for sure why some teams were chosen over others. But these are two theories that seem to make sense.</p>
