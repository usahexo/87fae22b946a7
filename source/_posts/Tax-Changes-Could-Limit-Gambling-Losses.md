#  Tax Changes Could Limit Gambling Losses

The new tax bill could place a $10,000 limit on the amount of losses from wagering that can be deducted from taxable income. This would especially affect professional gamblers, who often have large gambling losses in any given year.

Supporters of the measure say it is needed to prevent tax avoidance by high-earners, while opponents argue that it will make it more difficult for gamblers to offset their losses. The provision has not yet been finalized, and it remains to be seen whether it will be included in the final bill.

Gambling has been around for centuries, and is a popular pastime for many people. For some, gambling can be a fun way to relax and socialize, while for others it can be a serious addiction. Whatever your reason for gambling, if you lose money while doing so, you can currently deduct those losses from your taxable income.

Under the proposed tax bill, however, taxpayers would only be able to deduct gambling losses up to $10,000 per year. This would apply to all types of gambling, including casino games, lottery tickets, and betting on sports or horses. Taxpayers who have more than $10,000 in gambling losses would no longer be able to claim them as a deduction against their income.

The measure is intended to prevent high earners from using gambling losses as a way to reduce their taxable income. But critics say that it will simply make it more difficult for regular gamblers to offset their losses. They argue that most people who gamble are not wealthy and that this change could end up costing them a lot of money.

The provision has not yet been finalized and may still be changed before the final tax bill is voted on. It remains to be seen whether the $10,000 limit will actually be included in the final bill or whether it will be repealed altogether.

#  IRS Clarifies That Gambling Losses Are Still Deductible

In the recently released Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, there was a change made to the gambling losses that can be deducted on your taxes. The new law states that gambling losses are only deductible when they exceed your winnings for the year.

This change caused a lot of confusion among taxpayers, as it was not clear how this would be enforced. Would you only be able to deduct your losses up to the amount of your winnings, or would you be able to deduct all of your losses, regardless of how much you won?

The IRS has now released guidance on this issue, and has clarified that taxpayers are still able to deduct their gambling losses up to the amount of their winnings. This clarification should help to ease the confusion among taxpayers and make it easier to file their taxes.

If you have any questions about how this change affects you, please contact a tax professional for advice.

#  New Tax Law Limits Gambling Losses To $1,000 Per Year

The new tax law, which was passed in December of 2017 and goes into effect on January 1st, 2018, has a number of provisions that will impact individual taxpayers. One such provision is the limitation on gambling losses. Under the new law, taxpayers can only deduct gambling losses up to $1,000 per year.

This change is a significant decrease from the previous limit of gambling losses, which was unlimited. The purpose of the change is to reduce the amount of tax benefits that taxpayers can receive from gambling-related activities.

The new limit on gambling losses applies to all types of gambling activities, including casino games, online gambling, and lotteries. It also applies to taxpayers who itemize their deductions and those who take the standard deduction.

The reduction in the limit for gambling losses is likely to have a significant impact on taxpayers who regularly gamble. For example, a taxpayer who typically loses $2,000 per year on casino games would now only be able to deduct $1,000 of those losses. This could result in a higher tax bill for the taxpayer.

There are a number of exceptions to the new limit on gambling losses. The following items are not subject to the limitation:

- Gambling losses incurred in connection with horse racing or other legal forms of wagering

- Gambling losses incurred while traveling outside of the United States

- Gambling losses resulting from bad bets or debts owed to someone else

If you have questions about how the new limit on gambling losses may impact you, please contact your tax accountant or attorney.

#  Are You Aware That Gambling Losses Are Tax Deductible?

Yes, gambling losses are tax deductible. This is according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The deduction is taken as an adjustment to income on Form 1040, Schedule A. The deduction can be up to the total amount of gambling income reported on the return.

There are some rules that taxpayers need to follow in order to claim the deduction. First, the taxpayer must have had gambling income during the year. Gambling income includes winnings from lotteries, raffles, horse races and casinos. It also includes cash and prizes won from playing poker and other games of chance.

Second, the taxpayer must itemize deductions on their return. Most taxpayers will not itemize deductions since the standard deduction has been increased in recent years. For 2017, the standard deduction is $6,350 for singles and $12,700 for married couples filing jointly.

Third, the taxpayerâ€™s gambling losses must be more than their gambling income. If they have only $100 of gambling income but $1,000 in losses, they cannot claim a deduction for their losses.

Fourth, the taxpayer can only deduct losses up to the amount of their gambling income. So if they have $5,000 in gambling income and $2,000 in losses, they can only deduct $2,000 in losses.

Finally, the taxpayer must keep records of their wins and losses. This includes documentation such as receipts or tickets stubs. Without this evidence it may be difficult to prove that the losses were related to gambling activity and not some other activity loss.

The deduction for gambling losses is a valuable tax break for those who gamble. It can help reduce their taxable income and save them money on their taxes.

#  Gambling Losses Now Limited To $1,000 Per Year

The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that gambling losses are now limited to $1,000 per year. The Supreme Court's decision in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association overturns a 26-year-old federal law that had prohibited states from limiting the amount of money people can lose while gambling.

Justices ruled 6-3 that the 1992 law violated the 10th Amendment, which reserves for the states any powers not granted to the federal government in the Constitution. The amendment was passed in 1791 as part of the Bill of Rights and is one of the most important constitutional protections of state sovereignty.

Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority that "the proper analysis is whether Congress exceeded its authority under Article I of the Constitution by infringing on state sovereignty." Alito noted that "Congress does not have the authority to directly regulate or prohibit all aspects of state gaming operations."

In a dissenting opinion, Justice Elena Kagan said that Congress had decided to "leave it to the States to decide how much to permit their citizens to wager and how much to tax them on their winnings." She added that "this is emphatically not a case about federalism" but rather "a case about Forty-Six Statutes Which Say One Thing And The Supreme Court Says They Mean Something Else."

The 1992 law, known as PASPA (the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act), was passed by Congress in response to a 1987 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that allowed Las Vegas casinos to offer sports betting. PASPA made it illegal for states other than Nevada to offer sports betting, and also prohibited sports betting sponsors from advertising in states where it was illegal.

A coalition of New Jersey casino owners, led by former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, challenged PASPA as unconstitutional, arguing that it took away state sovereignty over gambling issues. In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear their case.

The court's ruling means that states are now free to legalize and regulate sports betting, subject to any applicable state laws and regulations governing gambling activities. It is estimated that legalizing sports betting could generate up to $5 billion in annual revenue for states that choose to allow it.
