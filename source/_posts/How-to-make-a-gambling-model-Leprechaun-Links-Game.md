## Introduction
In this article, we will show you how to make a Leprechaun Links game. This is a gambling game that uses a leprechaun as the character. The game can be played with a partner or against the computer.

## Creating the Game Board
The game board consists of two parts – the playing field and the leprechaun’s home. The playing field is a 6x6 square, with each square numbered 1-36. The leprechaun’s home is in the top left corner of the playing field and is a 3x3 square.



To create the playing field, open a new document in your favorite text editor and enter the following:

Then save the file as “playing_field.txt” or something similar. You can now open it in a web browser to see the image above.



Next, we will create the leprechaun’s home. Enter the following into your text editor:

Save this file as “leprechaun_home.txt” and open it in your web browser to see the image above.



Now that we have created the game board, we need to create the rules for how to play it.

So you want to make a gambling model Leprechaun Links Game? Well, you have come to the right place! I am going to show you how to make a game that works and is fun for players.

The first thing you need to do is come up with a game idea. What type of game do you want to make? Do you want to make a card game? A board game? A dice game?

Once you have decided on the type of game, you need to come up with a specific game. For this tutorial, we are going to be making a Leprechaun Links Game. This is a type of golf game where players try to get their ball from one end of the board to the other by playing links (like in golf).

Now that we have our game idea and our specific game, we need to create our board. The board will consist of two parts: the starting area and the finish area. The starting area will be 3x3 squares and the finish area will be 5x5 squares. You can use any size squares you want, but these sizes work well for our purposes.

Now that we have our board, we need to create our cards. These cards will be used as our playing pieces. We will need 12 different cards (1 for each player) and each card will represent a different type of link (e.g., straight, curve, uphill, etc.). You can create your own cards or use clip art like I have done below:

 
Now that we have our cards created, we need to create our rules for the game. Here are the basic rules: 
- Each player starts with 1 ball at the starting area
- Players take turns playing links until they either reach the finish or lose their ball
- If a player loses their ball, they must pick it up and move it back to the starting area
- The first player to reach the finish wins

## Introduction 

So you want to make a gambling game? Great! This tutorial will show you how to make a very simple gambling game called Leprechaun Links.

Leprechaun Links is a very simple game that can be easily modified to fit your own needs. In this game, players will click on different links to win or lose money. The goal is to click on as many winning links as possible and end up with more money than you started with.

Let's get started!

#  How to make a gambling model Leprechaun Links Game in Excel!

Hey everyone! Today, we're going to be learning how to make a gambling model Leprechaun Links Game in Excel! This is a really fun and easy game to make, and it's perfect for St. Patrick's Day or any other festive occasion. Let's get started!

The first thing we need to do is create the game board. To do this, we'll use a table with 12 rows and 12 columns. In each cell, we'll enter a number from 1-12. This will represent the position of the leprechaun on the board.

We'll also need to create a table of probabilities. This table will tell us which numbers are most likely to appear next. We'll create this table by counting the number of times each number appears in our 12x12 grid, and then dividing by the total number of tiles. Here's an example:

Number Appears in Grid Frequency Probability 1 2 0.167 2 6 0.500 3 3 0.250 4 5 0.417 5 8 0.667 6 7 0.583 7 4 0.333 8 1 0.083 9 10 1 10 11 2 11 12 1

Next, we'll create our Excel spreadsheet. We'll start by setting up our headers: "Board", "Probabilities", and "Output". Under "Board", we'll enter the table of numbers from our grid. Under "Probabilities", we'll enter our table of frequencies and probabilities from above. And under "Output", we'll simply enter the sum of all the numbers in our board column (i.e., the total number of tiles).

Now let's take a look at how our spreadsheet calculates our odds! When you roll the dice, it will automatically select a number from our Board column and highlight it in blue. The corresponding probability from our Probabilities column will then be displayed in green below it (this is what tells us which number is most likely to appear next). Our Output column will show us the new odds for that particular roll, as well as updating the total at the bottom of the sheet.

Step 1: In order to make this game, you will need a few materials.  You will need green and gold paint, a small green felt hat, a small pot of gold, some white cotton balls, and some black construction paper.

Step 2: Paint the bottom of the pot gold and let it dry.

Step 3: Cut a triangular shaped piece out of the green felt and attach it to the top front of the hat with some hot glue.

Step 4: Glue the white cotton balls around the edge of the top of the hat.

Step 5: Cut out two small black circles for eyes and attach them to the hat with hot glue.

Step 6: Paint your Leprechaun’s face green and let it dry.

Now that your Leprechaun is finished, it’s time to make the game board.  You will need a poster board or some cardboard for this.

Step 7: Draw a large square on the poster board or cardboard and then draw a smaller square inside of that one. This will be your game board.

Step 8: Cut out the game board using scissors or a craft knife. If you are using cardboard, you may want to reinforce the game board with some masking tape or duct tape so it doesn’t fold up on you during gameplay.


Now that you have everything you need, it’s time to start playing! To play, each player will need to chose a color – either green or gold.  Players will also need to choose one side of the game board to stand on – either green or gold.  The object of the game is to move around the outside of the game board until you reach the center square where your pot of gold is waiting for you! 

If you are playing with younger children, you can make this process a little bit easier by having them put one hand on top of another while they are moving around the board (similar to how they would play “Simon Says”). 

Whoever reaches their pot of gold first, wins!
