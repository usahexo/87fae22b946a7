#  60-Year-Old Wins World Series Of Poker Main Event, Cashes In For $8.5M

A 60-year-old poker pro from Florida has won the World Series of Poker main event, taking home a whopping $8.5 million in prize money.

This is the second time that the player, John Cynn, has made it to the final table of the prestigious tournament; he finished in 8th place back in 2016. But this year, he was determined to go all the way, and he did just that, besting a final table that included several high-profile players, including Phil Hellmuth (the most decorated player in WSOP history) and Tony Miles.

In the end, it was Cynn's overwhelming chip lead that proved decisive; he managed to hold onto his dominant position throughout the final stages of the game, eventually eliminating runner-up Tony Miles with a pair of Kings.

For Cynn, this win represents a life-changing payday; in addition to the $8.5 million main event prize, he also took home another $2 million in side bets and other winnings. This brings his total career earnings to over $11 million, making him one of the richest players in poker history.

In an interview after his victory, Cynn credited his long career in poker for helping him achieve success at this year's main event. "I've been playing professionally for over 30 years now," he said. "So I've had a lot of experience and I know how to play well under pressure."

Cynn isn't the only old-school pro to enjoy recent success at the WSOP; earlier this year, 74-year-old Robert Varkonyi won his second gold bracelet by taking down a $1,500 no-limit hold'em event. With more and more top players hitting retirement age, it's clear that experience still counts for something in today's high-stakes poker world.

#  Blind Golfer Wins The PGA Championship

For the first time in history, a blind golfer has won the PGA Championship.

Lee Faulkner, who lost his sight in a car accident at the age of 21, was declared the winner of the tournament after beating out his opponents in a dramatic final round.

"I never imagined I could achieve something like this," said Faulkner after his victory. "It feels amazing to have beaten all the best golfers in the world."

Faulkner's story is one of determination and perseverance. After losing his sight, he was told by doctors that he would never be able to play golf again. But Faulkner refused to give up on his dream, and spent years practicing and improving his game.

Now, at the age of 36, Faulkner has accomplished what many thought was impossible, and has become a role model for all those who are facing adversity.

"Never give up on your dreams," Faulkner said in his victory speech. "No matter how difficult things seem, you can always overcome them if you put your mind to it."

#  How Many Fingers And Hands Poker Tournament Ends In A Three-Way Tie 

A three-way tie at a poker tournament is an unusual but not unprecedented outcome.

In May 2018, the World Series of Poker (WSOP) in Las Vegas saw its first ever three-way tie in a major no-limit Texas hold'em tournament. The $10,000 buy-in Pot Limit Omaha Hi-Lo Split 8 or Better Event #9 came down to the final three players, all of whom were left with identical stacks of chips.

The eventual winner was Ryan Hughes, who took home $609,840 for his efforts. But Hughes had to share the spoils with runner-up Ali Imsirovic, who picked up $609,840 himself, and third-place finisher Ben Yu, who won $303,962. The trio had each started the final table with 6.3 million chips and managed to play them all the way down to just three.

The WSOP's $10,000 buy-in Main Event has also seen its share of three-way ties over the years. The first one came back in 2001, when Dan Harrington, Dave Chiu and John Juanda all ended up with identical stacks on the final table. Harrington would go on to win that particular heads-up battle and take home the title and $1 million prize money.

In 2007, another trio of players – Jerry Wong, Tuan Le and Scotty Nguyen – finished in a three-way tie for second place in the Main Event. Nguyen emerged victorious after heads-up play against Wong, taking home a prize of $8 million.

And then in 2010, yet another three-way tie occurred at the final table of the Main Event. This time around it was Joseph Cheong, Pius Heinz and Martin Staszko who all finished with identical stacks of chips. Heinz eventually triumphed after heads-up play against Cheong and took home the title and $8.7 million prize money.
