#  Vatican express condemnation of all gambling

On Tuesday, the Holy See issued an official condemnation of gambling in all its forms. The statement, released by the Vatican press office, said that the Church considered gambling a "grave sin" that harms both individuals and society as a whole.

The statement denounced all forms of gambling, including state-run lotteries, as "a deplorable exploitation of human weakness." It called on governments to ban gambling and urged Catholics to abstain from it.

This is not the first time that the Vatican has spoken out against gambling. In 2010, then-Cardinal Ratzinger (now Pope Francis) issued an encyclical condemning the "evils" of gambling.

While some Catholics may welcome this latest statement, it is likely to be met with criticism from those who argue that gambling is a personal choice and should not be subject to Church interference.

#  Archbishop says church's stance on gambling unchanged

The Archbishop of Canterbury has said that the Church's stance on gambling has not changed, despite moves by the government to liberalize the industry.

In a statement, the Archbishop said that the Church "continues to believe that gambling is not something that should be encouraged or promoted." He added that the organization would "continue to oppose any measures which seek to expand and increase opportunities for gambling."

The statement comes in the wake of plans announced by the government last year to relax regulations on betting shops and casinos. The changes, which are due to come into effect in April, will allow larger casinos to open in Britain and will also see the maximum stake on Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBTs) increased from £2 to £100.

The government has argued that the changes are necessary in order to boost tourism and create jobs. However, they have been fiercely opposed by campaigners who argue that they will lead to an increase in problem gambling.

In his statement, the Archbishop said that the Church was "committed to working with others" to address the issue of problem gambling. He added that he hoped the government would "heed our concerns" and reconsider its plans.

#  Cardinal urges laity to heed church's stance on gambling

Pope Francis has urged the Catholic laity to heed the church's stance on gambling, saying it was "evil" and " displeasing to God".

In a statement released over the weekend, the Pope said that gambling "offends against the wisdom of God", leading people away from what is truly important in life.

He also warned that gambling can be addictive and lead to crime, financial ruin and family breakdown.

The comments from the Pope came in response to a question about whether or not Catholics could play the national lottery.

While Pope Francis didn't specifically mention lotteries, his remarks are thought to apply equally to all forms of gambling.

The Catholic Church has long been opposed to gambling, seeing it as a form of exploitation that disproportionately affects the poor.

Last year, the Archbishop of Melbourne urged Australian Catholics to resist the temptation of gambling, saying it was "a toxic addiction that ruins lives".

#  Bishop reiterates that gambling is sinful

The Catholic Church has always taken a strong stance against gambling, and this was reiterated by Bishop Robert Barron in a recent sermon. He said that gambling is a sin because it promotes greed and covetousness.

He pointed out that the root of all sin is the desire to be God. Gambling, he said, encourages people to put their trust in earthly things rather than in God. This can lead to addiction and ruined lives.

The bishop also noted that the profits from gambling often go to corrupt politicians and organized crime gangs. He urged Catholics to stay away from casinos and other forms of gambling.

Bishop Barron's words echo those of Pope Francis, who has spoken out against the harms of gambling on several occasions. The Pope has said that casinos are "a place of evil" and that they should be banned.

Catholics are called to live ethical lives, which means avoiding anything that might lead to sin. Gambling is definitely one of those things. So if you're looking for something fun to do, why not try one of the many Catholic-approved activities instead? There's plenty to choose from!

#  Church reiterates its opposition to all forms of gambling

The Catholic Church continues to oppose gambling in all its forms, reiterating the reasons why it is a moral evil.

There are a number of reasons why the Church opposes gambling. First and foremost, gambling is a form of exploitation because it takes advantage of the player’s need or desire for money. Gambling also encourages greed and materialism, can lead to addiction, and destroys relationships and families. It can also cause people to lose their jobs, homes, and life savings.

The Church teaches that gambling is morally wrong because it involves betting on something uncertain, which is contrary to the virtue of prudence. Gambling also violates the Eighth Commandment: “You shall not steal.” This commandment forbids not only theft but also any form of unjust taking or despoiling of what belongs to others.

Finally, by promoting chance rather than skill, gambling promotes a mentality that views life as a series of random events over which we have no control. This is contrary to the Christian belief in God’s Providence and undermines our faith in Him.
