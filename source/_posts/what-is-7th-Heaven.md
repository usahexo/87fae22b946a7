#  what is 7th Heaven Albert Einstein?

Albert Einstein is considered as one of the most influential physicists of the 20th century. Aside from his scientific discoveries, he is also well-known for his humanitarian efforts. One of these was the founding of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

The idea for the university came about in 1921 when Einstein was on a visit to Palestine. He was so impressed with the progress that Jews had made in setting up universities and schools that he decided to create one himself. He wanted to make it a world-class institution where people of all religions could come and learn together.

Einstein raised money for the university by giving lectures all over the world. He also helped to set up its paramilitary organization, which would protect the students from anti-Semitic attacks. In 1925, he became its first president.

The Hebrew University was finally opened in 1925 with Einstein as its first president. It soon became a major center of learning, with Jews and Arabs studying together. Over the years, it has produced many famous scholars, including several Nobel Prize winners.
