#  Baccarat player hits $4 million jackpot at Cherokee casino

Just north of Atlanta, in the Cherokee Nation, a baccarat player hit a $4 million jackpot this weekend. Reportedly, the lucky winner was playing at the casino’s high-limit table on Saturday when they turned up four aces.

Cherokee Nation Entertainment spokeswoman Amanda Clinton said that the casino was “thrilled for our guest and team member who won this life-changing amount of money.” She also urged other players to come out and try their luck at the baccarat table.

This is not the first time that Cherokee Casino has had a big winner. In February 2017, another player hit a $3 million jackpot there. The casino is one of the largest in Oklahoma, with over 2800 electronic games and nearly 100 table games. It is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Casino officials are not releasing any information about the winner, including their name or hometown. However, they have confirmed that the lucky player is already a millionaire.

#  History-making baccarat win at Cherokee

In early November, Native American casino Cherokee in west North Carolina witnessed a history-making event: the first time a woman has won a baccarat jackpot. Arlene Wright, an avid gambler who visits the casino at least twice a week, hit the $27,000 top prize on a $10 bet. Wright was understandably ecstatic about her win. "I still can't believe it," she said. "My heart's just pounding."

Wright plans to use her windfall to pay off some bills and take a much-needed vacation. She's also considering donating some of her winnings to charity. "I feel very blessed," she said.

Cherokee staff congratulated Wright on her win and praised her for being a valued customer. Casino officials said they were glad she'd been able to hit such a big jackpot and that they looked forward to seeing her again soon.

This story is a reminder that lady luck can smile on anyone, no matter who you are or what you do. If you're ever feeling down, just remember that someone, somewhere is having a better day than you!

#  Baccarat player wins nearly $1.5 million at North Carolina casino

Jason Strasser, a professional baccarat player, won nearly $1.5 million from the casinos in North Carolina in a three-day span last week.

On July 21st, Strasser took home $565,000 from the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh. The very next day, he walked away with $575,000 from the Mount Airy Casino Resort in Mount Pocono. And finally, on July 23rd, he won another $417,000 from Harrah’s Cherokee Casino Resort.

This is not the first time that Strasser has had such success at the casino. In fact, over his career he has won over $6 million playing baccarat.

What is it about this game that has made him so successful?

Baccarat is a simple game to play but can be very complex to master. There are only three possible outcomes – player win, banker win, and tie. The object of the game is to bet on which of those three outcomes will occur.

Strasser focuses on betting on the player outcome and uses a very strict betting system that gives him an advantage over the house. He never deviates from his plan regardless of how much money he is winning or losing on any given day.

Some experts claim that there is no such thing as a guaranteed winning strategy in baccarat, but Strasser’s results show that this may not be the case.
